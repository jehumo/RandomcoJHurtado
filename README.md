# User list Async / Await - SwiftUI 

Showing information about users with SwiftUI.

• Downloaded a list of random users from http://randomuser.me/ API. GET

    • Showed a list of random users with this information sorted by name:
        o User name and surname. o User email.
        o User picture.
        o User phone.
        
    • Remove duplicated users. When returning the same user more than
once we  just present one user by using sets.


• Button to retrieve more users and add to your current users list.
• Button to each cell to delete users. If you press that button your user will not
be shown anymore in your user list.
• Button to each cell to mark users as favorite.
• Tapping the user picture you have to show another view with the user detailed information:
    o User gender.
    o User name and surname.
    o User location: street, city and state. o Registered date.
    o User email.
    o User picture.


• Text box to search users by name, surname or email. Once the user stop typing, your list will be updated with users that matches with the search term.
• Supporting 2 tab bars with to show two lists: one with all users and other with favorite users.

• Created another view, similar to the first one, to show users marked as favorite.
• Added some checkboxes to your UI to sort users by name and gender.
